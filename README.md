A repository for Godot build and release infrastructure using [@coffeebeats](https://github.com/coffeebeats?tab=repositories)' tools.

## **How it works**

This repository contains a number of GitHub actions useful for compiling and exporting Godot projects. See [Example usage](#example-usage) below for demonstrations of how to use the repository.

### Supported platforms

Currently, `godot-infra` supports targeting three platforms:

- `macos`
- `web`
- `windows`

### Supported Godot versions

This repository supports multiple minor versions of Godot. The `main` branch always contains the latest `godot-infra` changes and targets support for the latest Godot stable release. See the list below for the mapping of `godot-infra` release versions to supported Godot version.

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended to use the release tag as the version pin in your GitHub Actions workflow files since these represent stable, tested versions of this project.

#### Branch name / Release tag: Godot version

- `main` / `v2`: `v4.4.1`
- `v1`: `v4.3`
- `v0`: `v4.2`

## **Getting started**

The `godot-infra` repository does not need to be installed. Simply add the actions defined in the repository to your GitHub actions workflows.
